				<h2 class="mt-3 mb-3">What to do if the Police Station refuses to register the FIR ?</h2>

				<p class="mb-4">If a police station in India refuses to register an FIR, politely request reconsideration from the officer in charge. If unsuccessful, escalate to higher-ranking officers or file a complaint with the Superintendent of Police or Commissioner of Police. Legal action under Section 156(3) of the CrPC or seeking assistance from higher authorities may be necessary. Consulting a criminal lawyer and documenting interactions are essential for resolution.</p>

				<h2 class="mt-3 mb-3">Can Police call someone for investigation even if granted anticipatory bail by the court ?</h2>
				
				<p class="mb-4">Yes, certainly. The court only forbids the arrest but does not prevent police from calling the accused for investigation. Intact, invariably it is one of the conditions of the anticipatory bail    that the accused shall make himself available for investigation as and when required by the investigating officer. Refusal to do so may entitle the investigating officer to move the court      for cancellation of anticipatory bail. In case the investigating officer finds that a criminal case     is made out against an accused granted anticipatory bail by the court, he will not arrest him     but will release him on bail, even if the offence is Non-Bailable.</p>

				<h2 class="mt-3 mb-3">Is it an offence to register/lodge false Complaints ?</h2>

				<p class="mb-4">Yes. Lodging of a false FIR/complaint is punishable under IPC. Such an informant /  complainant can be proceeded against under section 182 IPC or under section 211 IPC          by the police. Private person against whom false FIR/complaint has been lodged can also file complaint in the court for the offence of defamation.</p>
